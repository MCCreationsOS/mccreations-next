                <p className="indent-4"> Only you, or a person registered with the California Secretary of State that you authorize to act on your behalf, may make a verifiable consumer request related to your personal information. You may also make a verifiable consumer request on behalf of your minor child. </p>
                <p> You may only make a verifiable consumer request for access or data portability twice within a 12-month period. The verifiable consumer request must: </p>

                <p className="indent-4"> We cannot respond to your request or provide you with personal information if we cannot verify your identity or authority to make the request and confirm the personal information relates to you. Making a verifiable consumer request does not require you to create an account with us.

                <p className="indent-4"> We will only use personal information provided in a verifiable consumer request to verify the requestor's identity or authority to make the request.

                <p className="indent-4"> If you have an account with us, we will deliver our written response to that account. If you do not have an account with us, we will deliver our written response by mail or electronically, at your option. </p>
                <p className="indent-4"> Any disclosures we provide will only cover the 12-month period preceding the verifiable consumer request's receipt. The response we provide will also explain the reasons we cannot comply with a request, if applicable. For data portability requests, we will select a format to provide your personal information that is readily useable and should allow you to transmit the information from one entity to another entity without hindrance. </p>
                <p className="indent-4"> We do not charge a fee to process or respond to your verifiable consumer request unless it is excessive, repetitive, or manifestly unfounded. If we determine that the request warrants a fee, we will tell you why we made that decision and provide you with a cost estimate before completing your request. </p>

                <p> We will not discriminate against you for exercising any of your CCPA rights. Unless permitted by the CCPA, we will not: </p>
                <ul className="list-disc list-inside">
                    <li>Deny you goods or services.</li>
                    <li> Charge you different prices or rates for goods or services, including through granting discounts or other benefits, or imposing penalties. </li>
                    <li>Provide you a different level or quality of goods or services.</li>
                    <li> Suggest that you may receive a different price or rate for goods or services or a different level or quality of goods or services. </li>
                </ul>
                <p className="indent-4"> However, we may offer you certain financial incentives permitted by the CCPA that <strong>can result</strong> in different prices, rates, or quality levels. Any CCPA-permitted financial incentive we offer will reasonably relate to your personal information's value and contain written terms that describe the program's material aspects. Participation in a financial incentive program requires your prior opt in consent, which you may revoke at any time. </p>
